# KANARIA WEBSITE.
This project is a website based on a japanese musician named Kanaria. The website is made to advertise his latest songs, and to share more information about him and his music.

# Design Process
My Design Process:
The first step was to get a rough idea of what colours i'd associate with Kanaria because i like focusing on aesthetics first and plan out the rest later.
Kanaria's youtube songs usually consist of white, black, and another colour which is either red or blue (usually they use more red in their music videos) so for my website i decided to use black as the main background colours, white as the text and red for the secondary background colour.

I also decided on yellow as an minor fourth colour because of kanaria's vtuber model being black white red and yellow and I also decided to deviate a bit from my initial wireframe because it felt too boring or clunky to me.

USER STORIES:

As a new fan, I would like to be able to see Kanaria's new songs easily, so that I can view what else Kanaria has to offer
As someone who is a fan, I would like to know Kanaria's social media accounts, so that I can keep updated with Kanaria's content.
As someone who is a fan and would like to use Kanaria's songs in my projects or for public events, I would like to know their music usage guidelines, so that I don't get in trouble with their lawyer.
As someone who would like to contact Kanaria for business reasons, I would like there to be a contact us page so that I may speak to him.

# Features
# Existing Features
Feature 1 - navigation bar that allows user to navigate between the different parts of the fansite.

Feature 2 - video that scrolls with circular navigation... in songs page

Feature 3 micro interaction? - easy access to kanaria's top 4 popular songs in the home page via clicking the thumbnails of the songs. when hovering mouse above images, images will increase in size and gain colour (same for social media icons except social media icons dont get colour)

Feature 4 contact us page - sends email to a set email (my email...) when all inputs are filled in correctly.

# Features Left to Implement
- nil


# Technologies Used
- Web3Forms
This project uses Web3Forms to make sending emails and receiving them easier (used for the contact us page)

# Testing

1. Contact form:
i. Go to the "Contact Us" page
ii. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
iii. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
iv. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

2. Top 4 Songs Icons and Social Media Icons:
i. Go to the "Home" page
ii. Try clicking on each image and see if it sends you to their respective links

3. Video Carousel:
i. Go to the "Songs" page
ii. Try playing the videos by clicking on them (pause them after youve tested that the video is playable, why? its written in the problems part of this readme :"D.)
iii. Try clicking the arrow keys to change to a different video and check that both buttons are able to loop back to the first video.

The project looks normal on different browsers (tested google and microsoft edge), screen sizes (for most excluding ipad air and asus zenbook fold), and functions as intended


# PROBLEMS
- SONGS PAGE PROBLEM ONLY. currently most devices work except ipad air and asus zenbook fold because the arrow on the left will go offscreen for some reason but other than that they work. 

- the video carousel in the songs page has a problem. When you click one video and go to the next, the audio will keep playing and overlap with the current's audio if you play the current video. (tldr: video audio will overlap with each other when played at the same time.)

- contact us page,, email input allows inputs such as "as@sa" (if there is no @ sign and things behind the @ it wont allow the input though so... uh.. yay)
