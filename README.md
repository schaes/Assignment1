# Your Project's Name
This project is a website based on a japanese musician named Kanaria. The website is made to advertise his latest songs, and to share more information about him and his music.

# Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

My Design Process:
The first step was to get a rough idea of what colours i'd associate with Kanaria because i like focusing on aesthetics first and plan out the rest later.
Kanaria's youtube songs usually consist of white, black, and another colour which is either red or blue (usually they use more red in their music videos) so for my website i decided to use black as the main background colours, white as the text and red for the secondary background colour.

I also decided to deviate a bit from my initial wireframe because it felt too boring or clunky to me.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:


(As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

# Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.


- JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:


1. Contact form:
i. Go to the "Contact Us" page
ii. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
iii. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
iv. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
