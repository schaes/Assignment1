            <p class="description">Kanaria is a producer who made his debut in the VOCALOID scene at the age of 17. He has gained applaudable achievements with his music works, especially with his signature usage of GUMI's English voicebank to achieve Japanese-language vocals.
                He is also recognized by the consistent color scheme in his MVs, which usually is a bright red. Since the release of "QUEEN" and his debut album "「Kanaria.code」", he now noticeably keeps his MVs primarily blue, but he still occasionally brings back the red palette.
                His most popular song, "KING", has gained 87 million views (as of October 2024). Other notable songs include "Envy Baby", "Yoidore Shirazu", "QUEEN", and "Dec.". (taken from vocaloid wiki).
